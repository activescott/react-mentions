# A temporary fork of [React Mentions](http://signavio.github.io/react-mentions)

This is a temproary fork of [React Mentions](http://signavio.github.io/react-mentions) that contains a snapshot of the PR signavio/react-mentions#255 . It basically takes a snapshot from zenchef/react-mentions#feature/custom-regex-pr and makes minimal changes to allow it to be referenced directly from NPM. The only changes are updating .gitignore and committing the package files.
